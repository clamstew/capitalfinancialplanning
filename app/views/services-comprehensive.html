      <h2>Comprehensive Financial Plan</h2>

      <p>One of the ways to build a roadmap to financial freedom is through a comprehensive financial plan. We can provide such a plan which will assist you in achieving your financial goals and objectives. The components of a comprehensive plan include not only the retirement planning, estate planning, and investment planning described in other parts of this website but also educational planning for the funding of college education or other educational goals and tax planning to suggest tax advantages you might otherwise overlook. With a financial roadmap you will be more confident about how to find financial freedom.</p>

      <h2>Modular Plan</h2>

      <p>You may wish to concentrate on just one component of a financial plan, for example: "retirement", in which case a modular plan could be prepared for you to address that specific concern.</p>
